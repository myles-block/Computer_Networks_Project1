To utilize the code, you must first connect to the Github repository containing the code via your computer’s terminal. The command to do so is git clone https://github.com/myles-block/Computer_Networks_Project1.git. Once the Github s successfully cloned, the user will be able to run the code via sudo python3 computer_networks_project1.git/tester_traceroute.py. After inputting the range of IP addresses, the user will be able to get the IP address of various routers across Howard University's Network. 

An alternative means is to clone the github in an code editor similar to Visual  Code Studio and running it via the command “sudo python3 traceroute.py”.
